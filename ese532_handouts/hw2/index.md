```{admonition} Due

In this assignment, we will profile an application on an
ARM core on AWS (same architecture as we will eventually use on the Zynq
MPSoC UltraScale on the  Ultra96-v2).

You probably want to read through the entire assignment (including the
[Homework Submission](homework_submission) section) before you start to work on the assignment.
