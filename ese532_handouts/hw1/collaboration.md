# Collaboration
In this assignment, you work with partners that we assigned.  You can find
the assignment on Canvas in the *Partners* map under the
*Files* section.  In the event that
the partner assignment does not work out (e.g., your assigned partner
has already dropped the course), contact the instructor or TA as soon
as possible.\ 

You can certainly do this assignment alone.
Everyone should be learning how to use all the tools, so don't take this as
an opportunity to compartmentalize who knows how to do what. 
Our rationale for pairs for this first assignment is so that you can reason
together on how to get the tools to work. 
% (and because we don't have enough Ultra96-v2 boards to go around).
For future assignments, you will have a different
partner that we will assign---all the more reason to make sure everyone knows
how to use Biglab/Detkin/Ketterer machines and is setup with their own accounts.
% If you cannot find a partner, we encourage you to look on Piazza
%    for other students without partners.  Piazza has functionality that allows you to
%    search for teammates.  In the event that you are unable to find a partner, contact
%    the instructor or TA.

In general, we are allowing you to work in pairs because it is useful to
discuss the material, tools, and designs with someone.  We
***do not allow*** arbitrary
collaboration in the course (see course policies
<http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ese532>), so this gives you a path for
allowed collaboration.  Pair programming is generally a useful technique,
which this will allow you to use.

***Each student should submit a complete report.***  You are free to share information
about how to perform certain activities using the Xilinx software with other
students.  In fact, we encourage you to share any difficulties that you have with
the software and general solutions or workarounds for them on Piazza.  However, ***you are
not allowed to share the results*** (e.g. output files, numbers, graphs) that you obtain
using the software outside of the pair working together on the assignment.  Moreover,
***final results should be analyzed and conclusions should be drawn individually***.

```{warning}
All students must follow the [Code of Academic Integrity](https://catalog.upenn.edu/pennbook/code-of-academic-integrity/).
Infringement of the code can have ***severe consequences*** for you and your partner, such as ***failing the course
or cancellation of your student visa*** if you are an international student, so please
familiarize yourself with them.  See the course policies on the course
web page <http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ese532> for full details of
our policies for this course.
