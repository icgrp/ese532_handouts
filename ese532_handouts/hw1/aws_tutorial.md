# Getting Started on Amazon EC2
```{include} ../common/aws_caution.md
```
## Basic Model
For this course, as a minimum, we need you to have a machine
that you can use for software development. A typical configuration
is Intel Core i5 + 256GB SSD + 8GB RAM. You can use any OS---
Mac/Linux/Windows, however, keep in mind that Xilinx only supports
Linux and Windows (you can use [this video tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HaOWfmCAyCE) to run Linux on a virtualization software).

For HW 1-4, we will use a command-line workflow. We will introduce some Xilinx
specific GUI workflow in HW 5-7. You will need to be comfortable with using
a terminal. We will be using a terminal to ssh into an Amazon instance.

To edit your source files, you can use vim or emacs directly in the remote terminal.
Or you can ssh from an editor in your local machine to edit files remotely.
For instance:
- [Remotely edit files using SSH from VS Code in Mac/Linux/Windows](https://medium.com/@christyjacob4/using-vscode-remotely-on-an-ec2-instance-7822c4032cff) 

## Create an AWS account
Go to <https://aws.amazon.com/>, click on ***Create an AWS account***, and follow the instructions.
- Select ***Type of Account*** to be ***Personal***.
- Add your ***Payment Info*** (this is required even though we will be using
a coupon).
- Select ***Support Plan*** to be the ***Basic Plan***.
- Proceed by clicking ***Sign in to the Console***.

## Note down your Account ID
We will need this to get you access to F1 instances, while you work
with A1 instances. Go to the following page, find your Account ID and
put it in your [report](homework_submission).
```{image} images/aws_account_id.png
```

## Redeem Coupon
Go to this link: <https://aws.amazon.com/awscredits/> and click on
***Redeem Credit***. In the follow-up screen, add your coupon code
that we gave you, type the captcha and click on ***Redeem***

## Usage and Costs
We will be using two types of instances:
- For homework 1-4 we will use an `a1.xlarge` with ARM cores.
It costs `$0.102/hr`.
- For homework 5-7 we will use an `f1.2xlarge` with Xilinx FPGAs.
It costs `$1.65/hr`.

Students from the past offerings of this class reported that they took about
9-16 hours on average to complete an assignment. Given that, we expect a total
usage of $\$$$0.102$ $\times$ $16$ $\times$ $4$ $+$ $\$$$1.65$ $\times$ $16$ $\times$ $3$ $\approx$ $\$$$86$ per student for doing all the assignments
on Amazon AWS. We are giving you $\$$$150$ in credit---so there is some leeway.
For the project, you will have the option to use SEAS Biglab or use up the rest of
the AWS credits or build locally (if you manage to have a local installation of
Xilinx Vitis/Vivado tools).

## Create and Launch an A1 instance
First make sure you the region you have selected is `N. Virginia us-east-1` from the top right corner of the screen:
```{image} images/launch_a1_0.png
```
---
From the management console, click on ***Launch a virtual machine***:
```{image} images/launch_a1_1.png
```
---
Select ***Amazon Linux 2 AMI (HVM)*** as your AMI and make sure ***64-bit (Arm)***
is checked.
```{image} images/launch_a1_2.png
```
---
Select ***a1.xlarge*** instance type and click on ***Review and Launch***
```{image} images/launch_a1_3.png
```
---
Select ***Launch*** on the current page. Create a key pair by giving a suitable
name and then selecting ***Download Key Pair*** (we will use this key to
ssh into the machine later). Now click on ***Launch Instance***.
```{image} images/launch_a1_4.png
```
---
You should see a screen as follows. Select ***View instances***.
```{image} images/launch_a1_5.png
```
---
Wait for your instance to be running. You can refresh the page by clicking
on the refresh button on the top right. Note down the ip address from the
bottom right.
```{image} images/launch_a1_6.png
```
---
Open a terminal and ssh into your machine using your key pair and ip
address (alternatively, [use VS Code to ssh in](https://medium.com/@christyjacob4/using-vscode-remotely-on-an-ec2-instance-7822c4032cff))
 ```
 ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000 -i /path/to/key_pair.pem ec2-user@<ip address of your machine>
 ```
 ```{note}
 We are tunnelling the remote port 8000 to our local port 8000
 using `-L 8000:localhost:8000`. We will use this port occasionally
 to serve a file for download/viewing. You can enable port 8000 globally
 in the security group of AWS if you want.
 ```
You should see a screen similar to the following:
```

       __|  __|_  )
       _|  (     /   Amazon Linux 2 AMI
      ___|\___|___|

https://aws.amazon.com/amazon-linux-2/
4 package(s) needed for security, out of 8 available
Run "sudo yum update" to apply all updates.
[ec2-user@ip-172-31-41-240 ~]$
```
---
Open the file `/etc/yum.repos.d/amzn2-core.repo` as follows and
enable debug info:
```Text
sudo vim /etc/yum.repos.d/amzn2-core.repo
# press 'i' to edit

# change the "enabled" from 0 to 1
[amzn2-core-debuginfo]
name=Amazon Linux 2 core repository - debuginfo packages
mirrorlist=http://amazonlinux.$awsregion.$awsdomain/$releasever/$product/$target/debuginfo/$basearch/mirror.list
priority=10
gpgcheck=1
gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-amazon-linux-2
enabled=1
metadata_expire=300
mirrorlist_expire=300
report_instanceid=yes

# write file and quit by pressing ':wq'
```
Execute the following commands. This will get the compiler necessary for
running homeworks 1-4.
```
sudo yum update -y
sudo yum groupinstall "Development Tools" -y
sudo debuginfo-install glibc-2.26-35.amzn2.aarch64 libgcc-7.3.1-9.amzn2.aarch64 libstdc++-7.3.1-9.amzn2.aarch64 -y
sudo yum install tmux -y
sudo yum install perf -y
```

---
Note down the system information and gcc version using the following
commands and put it in your [report](homework_submission).
```Text
lscpu
uname -a
gcc --version
```

---
Try the [Makefile Tutorial](makefile_tutorial) in this running instance!
```{tip}
When working in the terminal, use `tmux`. Sometimes your ssh connection
to AWS may drop. When you work inside `tmux`, you can continue
back from your previous terminal session. Learn more from [here](https://linuxize.com/post/getting-started-with-tmux/).
```

---
When you are done, stop the instance by right-clicking on the instance as follows:
```{image} images/launch_a1_7.png
```

---
You can re-start the instance by right-clicking on the instance as follows:
```{image} images/launch_a1_8.png
```
```{note}
The ip address changes when you restart an instance.
```

---
Check how much of credit you have used up as follows:
```{image} images/launch_a1_9.png
```
```{image} images/launch_a1_10.png
```
Take a screenshot of your credit usage and put it in your [report](homework_submission).

## Creating a budget
We put a warning message at the beginning of every
assignment to remind you to stop your instance. We understand that even with the
message, you may accidentally forget to stop your instance. 
Let's do one more thing to remind ourselves to stop our
instance.

In AWS, you can set a budget and get an alert if you cross
a threshold of that budget. We will complete about
3 homework assignments every month, and estimating we
will use a maximum of 16 hours per homework, our monthly usage
should be about 48 hours. 

From the billings page, click on the ***Budgets*** tab:
```{image} images/budget_1.png
```
Fill up the following screens as follows to set up an alert:
```{image} images/budget_2.png
```
```{image} images/budget_3.png
```
```{image} images/budget_4.png
```
```{image} images/budget_5.png
```
```{image} images/budget_6.png
```

## Transferring files between AWS and local machine

We highly encourage you to work in git repositories when you are editing
source code. You can create a private repository in github with
the starter code we provide you, and then you can git clone your repository
in your AWS instance. Make sure to build a habit of frequently committing
your work.

You can upload/download your work to/from AWS instance in several ways:
- You could just commit your updated code and outputs/logs into your
github repository and then access the github repository from anywhere.
- You could use `scp` as follows to transfer a single file or a folder
  between AWS and your local machine:
    ```
    # execute from your local machine
    # to upload a file
    scp -i /path/to/key_pair.pem FILENAME ec2-user@<ip address of your machine>:/home/ec2-user/FILENAME
    
    # to upload a folder
    scp -r -i /path/to/key_pair.pem FOLDER ec2-user@<ip address of your machine>:/home/ec2-user/
    
    # to download a file
    scp -i /path/to/key_pair.pem ec2-user@<ip address of your machine>:/home/ec2-user/FILENAME FILENAME
    
    # to download a folder
    scp -r -i /path/to/key_pair.pem ec2-user@<ip address of your machine>:/home/ec2-user/FOLDER ./
    ```
- Alternatively you can use `sshfs` to mount your AWS instance directory to a local folder: <https://www.digitalocean.com/community/tutorials/how-to-use-sshfs-to-mount-remote-file-systems-over-ssh>
- Lastly, you can execute `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` in your AWS instance,
and then go to <http://localhost:8000/> in your web browser to view/download your
file. Remember, you need to have the AWS port open/tunnelled for it to work (tunnelling with ssh: `ssh -L 8000:localhost:8000` or opening the port from AWS console).
