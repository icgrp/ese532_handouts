## Vectorization
We will divide the computation into vectors that run on 
the NEON units in our ARM cores.
{numref}`cortex-a72` shows the microarchitecture of the
ARM cores in our A1 instance. It's a 3-way decode, out-of-order
core with two 128-bit NEON SIMD units.

```
The Ultra96 boards have ARM Cortex A-53 cores. Compared to the A-72, it's a
2-way decode, in-order core with one 64-bit NEON SIMD unit,
as shown in {numref}`arm-core-table`.

We will use the NEON Intrinsics API to program the NEON
Units in our cores. An intrinsic behaves syntactically like a function,
but the compiler translates it to a specific instruction that is inlined
in the code. In the following sections, we will guide you through
reading the NEON Programmer's guide and learning to use these APIs.

## Obtaining and Running the Code
In the previous homework, we dealt with a streaming application that
compressed a video stream, and explored how to implement coarse-grain data-level parallelism
and pipeline parallelism using `std::threads` to speedup the application. For this homework,
we will use the same application and implement fine-grain, data-level
parallelism on a vector architecture;  we will explore both auto
vectorization with the compiler and hand-crafted NEON vector intrinsics. 

- Login to your `a1.xlarge` instance and clone the `ese532_code`
    repository using the following command:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/icgrp/ese532_code.git
    ```
    If you already have it cloned, pull in the latest changes
    using:
    ```
    cd ese532_code/
    git pull origin master
    ```
    The code you will use for [homework submission](homework_submission)
    is in the `hw4` directory. The directory structure looks like this:
    ```
    hw4/
        assignment/
            Makefile
            common/
                App.h
                Constants.h
                Stopwatch.h
                Utilities.h
                Utilities.cpp
            src/
                App.cpp
                Compress.cpp
                Differentiate.cpp
                Filter.cpp
                Scale.cpp
            neon_example/
                Example.cpp
        data/
            Input.bin (symlinks to hw3)
            Golden.bin (symlinks to hw3)
    ```
- There are 3 targets. You can build all of them by executing `make all`
    in the `hw4/assignment` directory. You can build separately by:
    - `make baseline` and `./baseline` to run the project with no vectorization of 
      `Filter_vertical` function.
    - `make neon_filter` and `./neon_filter` to run the project with `Filter_vertical` vectorized
      (you will modify the vectorized code later).
    - `make example` and `./example` to run the neon example.
- The `data` folder contains the input data, `Input.bin`, which has 100 frames of
    size $960$ by $540$ pixels, where each pixel is a byte. `Golden.bin` contains the
    expected output. Each program uses this file to see if there is a mismatch between
    your program's output and the expected output.
- The `assignment/common` folder has header files and helper functions used by the
    four parts.
- You will mostly be working with the code in the `assignment/src` folder.

## Working with NEON
We are going to do some reading from the arm developer website articles and
the NEON Programmer's Guide in the following sections.
### Basics

following questions. We have given you the answers, however make sure you
do the reading! Knowing where to look in a programmer's
guide is a skill by itself and we want to learn it now than later.

```{admonition} 9. Can there be a carry or overflow from one lane to another?
:class: dropdown
No.
```

Read [NEON and floating-point registers](https://developer.arm.com/documentation/den0024/a/armv8-registers/neon-and-floating-point-registers) and answer the
following questions:
```{admonition} 1. How many NEON registers are there in ARMv8 and what are they labeled as?
:class: dropdown
32 128-bit NEON registers, labeled as V0-V31.
```
```{admonition} 2. What is the difference between an operand labeled v0.16b and an operand labeled q0?
:class: dropdown
v0.16b is a vector register and has 16 lanes with each lane having 1 byte.
q0 is a scalar register of 128-bits.
```
```{admonition} 3. Are registered labeled b0, h0, s0, d0, q0 separate registers?
:class: dropdown
No, all of them belong to the same register v0. They are qualified names for registers when a NEON instruction operate on scalar data.

```{admonition} 1. Where are the NEON Intrinsics declared?

```{admonition} 3. When should you use intrinsics with 'q' suffix vs intrinsics without 'q' suffix?
:class: dropdown
When the input and output vectors are 64-bit vectors, don't use intrinsics with 'q' suffix.
When the input and output vectors are 128-bit vectors, do use intrinsics with 'q' suffix.
