# HW6: Accelerator Interface

```{admonition} Due
Friday, October 30, 5:00 PM
```
In this assignment, we will accelerate an application by implementing
  functions on the programmable fabric of Ultra96.

  Be warned that this homework requires a number of full Vitis builds, each of
  which can easily take 20--30 minutes, so begin on time and plan your schedule
  accordingly.
  <!-- Question~\ref{Interface}  requires 5
  builds and Question~\ref{Streaming} requires 5
  builds.  Question~\ref{Analyze} has no builds, so we suggest starting with it
  once you have completed Question~\ref{DMA} (you will need the full
  project information that comes from the question~\ref{DMA} build), such that you can work while
  other builds are running.  The builds in Question~\ref{Interface} do not
  depend on each other, so they can be run concurrently. -->

You probably want to read through the entire assignment (including the
[Homework Submission](homework_submission) section) before you start to work on the assignment.
