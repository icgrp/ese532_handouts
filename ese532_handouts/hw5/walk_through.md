## Hardware Acceleration
To implement a hardware function, it will ultimately be necessary
to perform low-level placement and routing of the hardware onto the
FPGA substrate.  That is, the tools must decide which particular instance of
each primitive is used (placement) or which wires to use for connections
(routing).  These tasks are typically much slower (at least 20 minutes, can take
hours) than the compilation time for software (a few minutes).  This means you
will need to plan your time carefully for this lab and for subsequent labs.
One way to optimize our development time is to be careful about when we
invoke low-level placement and routing and when we can avoid it.   This lab
and next will show you a few techniques that allow you to reduce the number of
times you need to invoke low-level placement and routing and introduce
 simulation and emulation you can use validate your design before
 invoking low-level placement and routing.

## Getting Started with Vitis on Amazon F1 Instance
### Pre-requisites
Make sure you complete the following pre-requisites before continuing
with this homework:
1. You have an AWS account and know how to create AWS 
    instances. Check {doc}`../hw1/aws_tutorial` for a refresher.
2. You have access to F1 instances. You can find out if you have
    access by going to the ***Limits*** tab in your AWS console
    homepage and then checking for the F1 vCPUs limit as
    follows. You should see at least 8 vCPUs limit for F1 instance. If you see 0, contact the course staff as
    soon as possible.
    ```{image} images/f1_vcpu_limit.png
    ```
3. Read about Vitis from [here](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-In-Depth-Tutorial/blob/master/Getting_Started/Vitis/Part1.md).

In this homework, we will use two instances:
- `z1d.2xlarge` referred to as the ***build*** instance where
    we will compile and build our fpga binary. It costs
    $0.744$/hr. You can create this instance in any AWS region.
- `f1.2xlarge` referred to as the ***runtime*** instance where
    we will run our fpga binary. It costs $1.65$/hr. We can
    only use `us-east-1` (N. Virginia) for this instance.

### Obtaining and Running the Code
In this homework, we will first run a matrix multiplication function on the cpu and then run the same matrix multiplication
function on the FPGA.

Login to your `z1d.2xlarge` instance and initialize your environment as follows:
```
tmux
git clone https://github.com/aws/aws-fpga.git $AWS_FPGA_REPO_DIR
source $AWS_FPGA_REPO_DIR/vitis_setup.sh
export PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS=$(dirname $AWS_PLATFORM)
```
```{caution}
Make sure to run under tmux! It will save you hours.
```

---
Clone the `ese532_code` repository using the following command:
```
git clone https://github.com/icgrp/ese532_code.git
```
If you already have it cloned, pull in the latest changes
using:
```
cd ese532_code/
git pull origin master
```
The code you will use for [homework submission](homework_submission)
is in the `hw5` directory. The directory structure looks like this:
```
hw5/
    Makefile
    design.cfg
    xrt.ini
    common/
        Constants.h
        EventTimer.h
        EventTimer.cpp
        Utilities.cpp
        Utilities.h
    hls/
        export_hls_kernel.sh
        run_hls.tcl
        MatrixMultiplication.h
        MatrixMultiplication.cpp
        Testbench.cpp
    Host.cpp
```
- There are 5 targets in the Makefile. Use `make help` to learn about them.
- `design.cfg` defines several options for the v++ compiler. Learn more about it [here](https://developer.xilinx.com/en/articles/using-configuration-files-to-control-vitis-compilation.html).
- `xrt.ini` defines the options necessary for Vitis Analyzer.
- The `common` folder has header files and helper functions.
- You will mostly be working with the code in the `hls` folder. The 
    `hls/MatrixMultiplication.cpp` file has the function that gets compiled
    to a hardware function (known as a kernel in Vitis). The `Host.cpp` file has
    the "driver" code that transfers the data to the fpga, runs the kernel,
    fetches back the result from the kernel and then verifies it for correctness.
- Read [this](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-In-Depth-Tutorial/blob/master/Getting_Started/Vitis/Part3.md#the-source-code-for-the-vector-add-kernel) to learn about the syntax of the code in `hls/MatrixMultiplication.cpp`.
- Read [this](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-In-Depth-Tutorial/blob/master/Getting_Started/Vitis/Part3.md#the-source-code-for-the-host-program) to learn about how the hardware function is
utilized in `Host.cpp`
- Read [this](https://developer.xilinx.com/en/articles/example-1-simple-memory-allocation.html) to learn about simple memory allocation and OpenCL execution.
- Read [this](https://developer.xilinx.com/en/articles/example-3-aligned-memory-allocation-with-opencl.html) to learn about aligned memory allocation with OpenCL.
- Run the matrix multiplication on the cpu by doing:
    ```
    # compile
    source $AWS_FPGA_REPO_DIR/vitis_setup.sh
    export PLATFORM_REPO_PATHS=$(dirname $AWS_PLATFORM)
    make all TARGET=sw_emu

    # run
    source $AWS_FPGA_REPO_DIR/vitis_runtime_setup.sh
    export XCL_EMULATION_MODE=sw_emu
    ./host mmult.xclbin
    ```
- We will now use Vitis Analyzer to view the trace of our matrix multiplication on cpu
    and find out how long each API call took.
    1. Read about how to use Vitis Analyzer from [here](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-In-Depth-Tutorial/blob/master/Getting_Started/Vitis/Part5.md).
    1. Open a remote desktop session on your `z1d.2xlarge` instance.
    1. Run `vitis_analyzer ./xclbin.run_summary` to open Vitis Analyzer and try to associate the api calls with the code in `Host.cpp`.
    1. Hover over an API call to find out long it took.
    
We are now going to start working on the {doc}`homework_submission` where we will follow a bottom-up approach and optimize our hardware function using Vitis HLS IDE first and then re-compile it and run it on the FPGA in the end. Scroll to {ref}`vitis_hls` to learn about how to
use Vitis HLS.

(vitis_hls)=
### Using Vitis HLS

Creating a new project in Vitis HLS is explained [here](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-In-Depth-Tutorial/blob/master/Getting_Started/Vitis_HLS/new_project.md#1-creating-a-vitis-hls-project).
Make sure you enter the top-level function during the creation of the
project (although you can also change it later).  The top-level function is
the function that will be called by the part of your application that runs
in software.  Vitis HLS needs it for synthesis.  You can also indicate
which files you want to create.  It is wise to add a testbench file too,
while you are creating the project.

We have provided a testbench in Vitis HLS to debug the hardware.
The requirements for testbenches are not any different from other
software applications written in C.  Similar to them, testbenches
have a `main` function that is invoked.  To the main function you can
add any functionality needed to test your function.  That includes calling
the top function that you would like to test.  When the testbench is
satisfied that the function is correct, it should return 0.  Otherwise, it
should return another value.


You can run the testbench by selecting ***Project*** $\rightarrow$ ***Run C Simulation*** from the menu.  A window should pop up.  The default settings of the dialog
should be fine.  You can dismiss the dialog by pressing ***OK***.  You
can see in the ***Console*** whether your test has passed.  If your test
fails, you can run the test in debug mode.  This can be done by repeating
the same procedure, except that you should check the box in front of
***Launch Debugger*** this time before you dismiss the dialog.  This
will take you to the ***Debug*** perspective, where you can set breakpoints and use the step into/step over buttons to debug.  You can go back to the original perspective by pressing the ***Synthesis*** button in the top, right corner.  

To rebuild the code, you should go back to Synthesis mode, and click ***Run C Simulation*** again to rebuild the code.

Once you are satisfied with your code, you can run ***Solution***
$\rightarrow$ ***Run C Synthesis*** $\rightarrow$ ***Active Solution*** from the menu
to synthesize your design.  You can also verify the synthesized version of
your accelerator in your testbench.  If you choose to do so, Vitis HLS
will run your accelerator in a simulator, so this method is called C/RTL
Cosimulation.  The employed cycle-level simulation is much slower than
realtime execution, so this method may not be
practical for every testbench.  It avoids needing to run low
level-placement and routing and will give you more visibility into the
behavior of your design.  Anyway, you can start it by choosing
***Solution*** $\rightarrow$ ***Run C/RTL Cosimulation*** from the menu.

The hardware implementation that Vitis HLS selects can be controlled
by including pragmas, e.g. `#pragma HLS inline`, in your code.
The different pragmas that you can use in your functions are listed in [Vitis HLS User Guide](https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/xilinx2020_1/vitis_doc/hlspragmas.html#okr1504034364623).

When you have obtained a satisfying hardware description in Vitis HLS, you will [Export Vitis Kernel](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-In-Depth-Tutorial/blob/master/Getting_Started/Vitis_HLS/dataflow_design.md#export-the-vitis-kernel), i.e. a Xilinx object file (.xo). We will then [use this object file/kernel](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-In-Depth-Tutorial/blob/master/Getting_Started/Vitis_HLS/using_the_kernel.md) and link it together in our existing Vitis application.

```{note}
We are using the GUI mode of Vitis HLS so that we can see the HLS schedule.
In this class, our preferred method of compiling is using the command line
and we'll only use GUI when it's required.

If your remote desktop connection is lagging, you can run Vitis HLS
from the command line using the script, `export_hls_kernel.sh`, 
in the `hw5/hls` directory. This script runs the TCL script, `run_hls.tcl`, 
with Vitis HLS. Vitis HLS GUI actually calls the commands in this TCL script.
If you look inside the TCL script, you can relate it to the GUI steps
we mentioned above. Additionally, you can learn more about the TCL commands
from:
- <https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/xilinx2020_1/vitis_doc/tre1585063528538.html>
- <https://www.xilinx.com/html_docs/xilinx2020_1/vitis_doc/nfj1539734250759.html>

Note that the only way to see the HLS schedule is through the GUI.
So collaborate with your partner if you are unable to use the GUI in AWS or try
to [install Vitis toolchain locally](https://github.com/Xilinx/Vitis-In-Depth-Tutorial/blob/master/Getting_Started/Vitis/Part2.md#vitis-flow-101--part-2--installation-guide).
```

(resume_build)=
### Run on the FPGA
Once you have 3h completed from the {doc}`homework_submission`,
continue with the following.
#### Compile a hardware function
- Start building the hardware function by doing `make afi EMAIL=<your email>`,
    substituting your email. This build will take about 1 hour 20 minutes and in the end
    it will wait for you to confirm a subscription from your email account; open your email and confirm
    the subscription and wait to receive an email that your Amazon FPGA Image (AFI) is available (takes about 30 minutes to an hour).

#### Set up a runtime instance
- Follow the steps from {ref}`launch_instance`, but instead of choosing
    a `z1d.2xlarge` instance, choose `f1.2xlarge`.

#### Copy binaries to the runtime instance
- Create a github repository and clone it in your `z1d.2xlarge` instance.
- Add the `host`, `mmult.awsxclbin` and `xrt.ini` files to the repository; commit and push.
- Git clone the updated repository in your `f1.2xlarge` instance.

#### Run the application on the FPGA
- Execute the following commands in your `f1.2xlarge` instance to run your application:
    ```
    source $AWS_FPGA_REPO_DIR/vitis_runtime_setup.sh
    # Wait till the MPD service has initialized. Check systemctl status mpd
    ./host ./mmult.awsxclbin 
    ```
- You should see the following files generated when you ran:
    ```
    profile_summary.csv
    timeline_trace.csv
    xclbin.run_summary
    ```
    Add, commit and push these files in the repository you created and then shutdown your F1 instance.
    ```{caution}
    Make sure to shut down your F1 instance! It costs 1.65$/hr
    ```

This concludes a top-down walk-through of the steps involved
in running a hardware function on the AWS FPGA.
