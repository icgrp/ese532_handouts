# HW5: Accelerator

```{admonition} Due
Friday, October 16, 5:00 PM
```
In this assignment, we will accelerate an application by implementing functions on the FPGA on the Amazon F1 Instance.

This assignment involves CAD tool tasks that take a long time.   We strongly recommend that you *start early*
on this assignment.

```{note}
Lectures for Vitis/OpenCL data model don't occur until the week the assignment is due. You aren't writing new code here, 
so we expect you can begin working through this and
things will become clearer during the week.
```

You probably want to read through the entire assignment (including the
[Homework Submission](homework_submission) section) before you start to work on the assignment.
