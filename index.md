As mentioned in the course homepage, we will award bonus points
for student-developed instructions and tutorials on how to solve
common tasks that arise for the tools. If you see an error/typo
or have a suggestion for the instructions, feel free to open an
issue or a pull request using the github button on top (each page
has its own button).
