# HW6 -- Accelerator Interface

```{admonition} Due
Friday, October 18, 5:00 PM
```
In this assignment, we will go deeper in host/kernel code optimization.

  Be warned that this homework requires a number of full Vitis builds, each of
  which can easily take 20--30 minutes, so begin on time and plan your schedule
  accordingly.
  <!-- Question~\ref{Interface}  requires 5
  builds and Question~\ref{Streaming} requires 5
  builds.  Question~\ref{Analyze} has no builds, so we suggest starting with it
  once you have completed Question~\ref{DMA} (you will need the full
  project information that comes from the question~\ref{DMA} build), such that you can work while
  other builds are running.  The builds in Question~\ref{Interface} do not
  depend on each other, so they can be run concurrently. -->

<!-- We are delayed in pulling together this assignment and will be releasing it
in segments so that you can go ahead and get started on the platform
transition (F1 to Ultra96) and first parts of the assignment while we
continue to debug and refine the later parts of the assignment.

Watch piazza and check back here for updates. -->

You probably want to read through the entire assignment (including the
