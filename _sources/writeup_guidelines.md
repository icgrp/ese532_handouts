# Writeup Guidelines

This document contains general guidelines for all writeups submitted to
fulfill homework and project assignments.  
%On one hand, some of these
%  guidelines may require some extra effort unfortunately.  On the other
%  hand, 
We hope they provide more clarity regarding our expectations.

In addition to the guidelines below, we have provided an example of what we consider a well-formatted submission <http://www.seas.upenn.edu/~ese532/fall2018/handouts/writeup_example.pdf>.

- Handwritten documents and figures are not accepted.  This includes
    electronic representations (e.g., scan, photograph) of handwritten documents and figures.
- Keep answers concise.  We specify a maximum number of lines for many
    of the questions for this purpose.
- Use the same numbering of your answers as the numbering used in the
    assignment.
- We do not expect you to repeat each question before answering it.  If
    it helps you, feel free to do it, but be aware that we do not care.
- Write your name, and the names of your partners, if applicable, at
    the top of your document.
- Make sure that your final answer can easily be identified.  Consider
    putting results in tables if that improves clarity.
- Provide only the significant part of numeric results.  If we ask the
    latency in cycles, for example, we generally do not want an answer
    like $5294939$ cycles because it is hard to read and you
    typically do not have that level of precision in your measurement.  Instead write
    something like $5.3$ Mcycles.
- Sufficient explanation must be provided for code, figures, and
    tables such that instructors do not have to guess what their purpose
    or meaning is.  Consider adding references to figures in your text,
    naming axes of figures, and adding captions to tables, for example.
- Screenshots of code are not accepted.
- Code must be formatted properly. You can use [Google C++ Style Guide](https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html). In Vitis, you can format a file easily by
    pressing $CTRL+SHIFT+F$ in an open file.
- Remove irrelevant comment (e.g. commented out code), and replace
    irrelevant code with an ellipsis.
- Information that was not strictly asked in the assignment and 
    long stretches of code and results (more than 1 page) must be put in an appendix.
- Information from other sources must be identified clearly.  Avoid
    plagiarism and credit the source properly.  Provide
    enough information that we can look up the source.  Links are also
    appreciated, but not required.
- Only code and results based on code that has been tested properly
    will be accepted.  Code that has obviously never been
    executed is clearly not acceptable and can be considered a violation
    of academic integrity.  To avoid this, test your code enough
    that you can be confident that any remaining bugs will not affect
    your results and conclusions significantly.
- Feel free to add any complaints and suggestions about assignments,
    partners, etc. to your submission.  If complaints are time-sensitive,
    we suggest contacting an instructor directly.  Please understand that
    we try to be fair to all students, so we often cannot accommodate
    complaints shortly before a deadline when other students may have
    submitted their document already.  Nevertheless, all feedback is
    more than welcome and will be handled discretely.
- Please run a spelling checker before submission.  Microsoft Word
    comes with a spelling checker.  In Linux, you can use
    `ispell` (or  `aspell`).
- Please include a statement on your final submission:
    ```Text
    I, *your-name-here*,  certify that I have complied with the
    University of Pennsylvania's Code of Academic Integrity in
    completing this final exercise.
    ```
